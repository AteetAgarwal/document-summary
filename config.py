Extract the following metadata from the provided content and return a valid JSON object. Follow these instructions precisely:

- Return only the JSON (no explanations, no Markdown).
- Use exact field names as defined.
- Do not guess or fabricate information.
- If information is missing, leave arrays empty.
- Clearly distinguish "base models" (e.g., PJ2-2B) from "model numbers" (e.g., PJ2-2B-100).
- Do **not** include the words "model" or "language" in any of the values.
- For "languages", detect any explicitly or implicitly mentioned human languages â€” e.g., file names ending in `_es.pdf` imply Spanish, or if a document is multilingual, infer accordingly.
- Include all language names in English (e.g., English, Spanish, French).

Return the result in this exact JSON format:

{{
  "title": "<concise title, max 100 characters>",
  "description": "<detailed, professional summary in the provided style>",
  "base_models": ["<base model names like PJ2-2B>"],
  "model_numbers": ["<full model numbers like PJ2-2B-WH>"],
  "languages": ["<language names like English, French>"]
}}

Content:

If you are unable to detect languages from the content, use your best judgment to infer the primary language based on the document text itself.
